# USMA Projects
In this repository you will find two files, both from my time as a cadet/student at the United States Military Academy. 

The XE475 Mechatronics Final Project is in C++ and was used with an Arduino Microcontroller to create a semi-autonomous RC Car. This code was hastily put together and is by no means an example of how my programming/code is normally written. It's intent was to test sensors and have all the code on one sheet for quick testing and adjustments. 

The Google Glass Independent Research is in Java and was a project designed to repurpose the Google Glass hardware to serve as a Helmet Mounted Display similar to the AH-64 Apache Helicopter Pilots, but for military members on the ground to use with robotics. The concept was where the user looks, the robot/cameras wireleslly connected would look in the same direction. The initial testing resulted in detecting the 3 axis of rotation of the user, and displaying a live feed through Wi-Fi. Next steps of the project were going to be transmitting this information across bluetooth.
