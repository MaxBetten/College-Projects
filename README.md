# Portfolio
Hi, my name is Max and I've been a hobby programmer for a while. I started in high school and have continued practicing my skills through college and afterwards. 
  My coding projects include code from an Arduino project in college where we worked on making an RC Car semi-autonomous
The other coding project from college involves code in Java repurposing Google Glass for a military purpose similar to a fighter or helicopter pilot's Helmet Mounted Display
In my other branch labeled BattleVernacular was a little coding project testing out a trivia game involving translating words
This is all still very much a work in progress as I explore more programming ideas and clean up my GitHub Portfolio
